# The Corporate Data Loader

## Overview
The corporate data loader (hereinafter termed 'CDL') is a tool for disaster recovery. It restores previously streamed 
data to HBase i.e. records that previously came over the kafka stream. It would be used where a table inconsistency or 
some other hbase issue has caused a data loss.

The data that has been put into HBase by Kafka-to-hbase is additionally written to s3. It is these s3 objects that CDL
processes and writes into HBase.

The process uses [HBases's bulk loading capabilities](https://hbase.apache.org/1.4/book.html#arch.bulk.load) which 
utilise map-reduce to prepare HFiles directly, hbase is then directed to adopt these files. A useful post on this 
technique can be found [here](https://blog.cloudera.com/how-to-use-hbase-bulk-loading-and-why/).

Each run of CDL should process files all destined for the same table , so many runs of CDL are needed to perform a full 
restore of each table's streamed data - one for each table in HBase. This is a requirement of the HBases incremental 
load feature which this application uses.  

## Local running
The application can only run on EMR. Until we have a licence for localstack pro (which provides EMR), testing will be
performed by the end to end tests.

## Running in the development environment.
Build the jar

    gradle build

Transfer the jar to s3 (replace the words `development-bucket` with and actual writable bucket in 33.)

    aws --profile dataworks-development s3 cp ./build/libs/corporate-data-loader-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar s3://development-bucket/

Transfer the script to run the jar to the same bucket (one time activity)

    aws --profile dataworks-development s3 cp ./resources/scripts/run.sh s3://development-bucket/

Log onto to the hbase master

    aws ssm ....
    
Fetch the jar and the script

    aws --profile dataworks-development s3 cp s3://development-bucket/corporate-data-loader-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar .
    aws --profile dataworks-development s3 cp s3://development-bucket/run.sh .

Create a table to load into (must match the table name specified in the script)

    hbase shell
    > create table 'agent_core:agentToDo', { NAME => 'cf', VERSIONS => 100 }

.. or truncate an existing table
    
    > truncate 'agent_core:agentToDo'

.. or do nothing and use an existing table.

Kick off the job

    ./run.sh 10
    
The script is very rough and ready and only for kicking off dev runs, alter the exported environment variables therein 
to suit your needs. The number passed in should be chosen to ensure a non-existent output directory is used - 
incrementing this number on each run should do the trick.

Check the logs

First you need to get the application Id which looks something like this `application_1601048545520_0023`, look for the 
line like this on the console after the run:

    20/10/01 08:45:43 INFO impl.YarnClientImpl: Submitted application application_1601048545520_0023
 
Then so see the logs:

    yarn logs --applicationId <id-determined-above>
